# Diamond_Price_Prediction

## Overview

we were assigned the task of predicting diamond prices based on carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and other relevant features.
The objective was to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a diamond given its characteristics.
To tackle this task, we employed a data-driven approach using powerful tools such as Power BI, Python, and PostgreSQL. Power BI facilitated exploratory data analysis, allowing us to visually explore relationships between different attributes and the target variable (price). Python was utilized for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and developing predictive models using regression techniques. PostgreSQL served as an efficient database management system to store and query the diamond dataset.
